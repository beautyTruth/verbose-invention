# Week off to what?

Yeah. The most enjoyable parts of my clean PTSD experience are the clarity of my flashbacks and the explosiveness of my panic attacks. Meditation helps. Walking helps. Music helps. Creating helps. Spondees help. Turtle. Hurdle. Wordle. Girdle. Ladle. Doing all of those things at the same time while staying away from any type of shortcut substance like weed, alcohol, or ativan makes life, eventually, worthwhile.

I’ve spent the past week battling panic attacks and flashbacks and writing unrhyming iambic pentameter. That battle prevented me from making digital art. Or thinking about it.

This time, I introduce to you **birbmax**. It's a nightclub for birbs. Or a coffee shop for birbs. Or a dating app for birbs. Or a low T supplement for birbs.

So it is with that in mind that I return to this medium. I’m seated at my desk making things. Please enjoy and use any of the things I’ve committed into this repo for your own purposes.
